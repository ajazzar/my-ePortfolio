        <div class="content">
            <p>My family and I like walking outside with Ginger, our Australian Labradoodle. 
            She is 7 years old and we usually take her on one or more walks every day. 
            She is a crossbreed dog: part Labrador Retriever, part Poodle, and part Cocker Spaniel.
            Her fur is reddish-brown and she does not shed.</p>
